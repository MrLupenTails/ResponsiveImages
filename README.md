# ResponsiveImages
Another Project I worked on while doing LinkedIn Learning Front-End Webdesign. This program automatically scales up images depending on the size of the view port by using JavaScript. 
Note that only the JavaScript was done by me, the website is a template taken from my Front-End Webdesign course.
